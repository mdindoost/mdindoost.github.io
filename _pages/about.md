### Current Work
- Lead developer of **HiPerMotif**, **HiPerXplorer**, and **VF2-PS**, open-source parallel algorithms for large-scale graph motif discovery.  
- Co-author of **MoMo** (collaboration with Harvard, RWTH Aachen, Zuse Institute Berlin, University of WÃ¼rzburg), applied in neuroscience connectome analysis.  
- Active contributor to **NSF-funded projects** on scalable community detection, graph coarsening, and HPC frameworks.  
- Developing new GNN models: **Motif-Augmented Message Passing (MMP)** and **TempAnom-GNN** (temporal fraud detection).  
- Extending **Combinatorial Multigrid (CMG)** to graph learning (pooling, unpooling, coarsening).  
- Contributor to [Arkouda-NJIT](https://github.com/Bears-R-Us/arkouda-njit), extending Chapel-based HPC analytics.
